# Hackintosh Installation Guide for Catalina on a Asus ROG Z390-I System

In the last view years I read a lot about "Hackintosh" setup and usages. I also talked a lot with people about their experiences made with Hackintosh systems. Now that I am working mainly in my home office I thought it was the right time to give it a try.

At this point in time I am working successfully with the hackintosh system at home. My main usage of the system is communication, office work and programming with Java and Container technologies.
Afterwards you will get some insights about my configuration, references and my experiences.

I used this guides as starting point:

## Experiences I made
<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

- Upgrade to OpenCore 0.6.8 was easy when using the tools OpenCore Configurator and OC_Gen-X (see section tools below).
- With using OpenIntelWireless I am also able to use the internal Wireless and Bluetooth capabilities.
- I would recommend to use this tools instead of do the manual way.
- First try your new configuration on a USB stick before finally moving the configuration to the EFIT "final" partition.
